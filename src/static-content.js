                     <strong>1. Leave a walkway to the rear of your unit </strong>  so you can easily access all your items.

                  <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>2. Disassemble bed frames and remove lampshades from lamps. </strong> This will help protect them from breaking, make them easier to move and help maximize storage space.

                  <div class="alert alert-success">

                   <div class="alert alert-success"> <strong>4. Crisscross masking tape across the face of mirrors </strong> or glass covered art.</div>

                   <div class="alert alert-success"> <strong>6. Polish wood items before packing </strong> to provide a little extra protection from the elements. </div>

                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>1. Take a little time to plan and organize as you pack. </strong> This should make it easier to finds things in the future and less likely that anything will get damaged during a move or while in storage.</div>

                     <strong>3. Avoid packing items in plastic bags</strong> as they are less sturdy and could trap moisture.</div>
                  
                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>4. Fill each box completely</strong> to prevent the top or sides from caving in.</div>
                  
                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>5. Fill open box space with crumpled paper,</strong> bubble wrap or other packing materials to protect odd shaped or loose items like glassware or toys.</div>
                  
                      <div class="alert alert-success">

                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>7. Don't make boxes too heavy to move.</strong> Use larger boxes for things that don't weigh much and smaller ones for the heavy stuff.</div>
                  
                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>8. Mark 'fragile' </strong> on boxes full of breakables.</div>
                  
                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>9. Use the right type of box or packing crate.</strong> For instance, use a heavy duty box for your books as this is less likely to break than a standard box.</div>
                      <div class="alert alert-success">
                     <strong>10. Use cell kits</strong> for glasses, stemware or knickknacks.</div>
                  
                      <div class="alert alert-success">

                          Also known as "temperature controlled" units, climate controlled storage units are just like storing something in your living room. Most climate controlled spaces are also interior space. Meaning they are accessed through a hallway inside the storage facility. Temperature is controlled using air conditioning and heat to keep items in a constant environment (temperatures between 55° and 85°F).

                          Drive-up storage is the most convenient self storage option. You can drive directly to your unit, load or unload and be on your way. There are no interior hallways, making it much easier to carry and store your heavy items. If you're storing something you would store in your garage, drive-up is your best option.

                          Outdoor storage is not generally climate controlled and won't protect you from bad weather. Also, don't be surprised if you find insects like spiders and pill bugs in your unit. These spaces aren't as protected as an interior unit. Indoor units can be either climate controlled or non-climate controlled and are accessed from a hallway by entering the main door of a building.

Additionally, site managers will often contact customers in default by phone prior to an auction process. As a customer, it is your responsibility to make sure we have accurate, up-to-date contact information, and to pay your bill on time.
